# Matrix Multiplier
This is a program that multiplies matrices for you. 

This program will ask the user to define their first matrix. The user will then have to enter the values of the matrix row by row.
The matrix will then be printed out and asks the user if the matrix is correct. If the user made a mistake the values can be given again. 

Same goes for the second matrix.

Finally the answer to the calculation will be printed out.
